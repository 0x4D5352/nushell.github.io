If you are a developer who would like to contribute to Nu, feel free to start working with us on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/nushell/nushell).  
We are also currently writing a [contributers book](https://github.com/nushell/contributer-book) which will help you to get started and dive deeper into the concepts which stand behind Nu, how they are implemented and . 

We also have active discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nu_shell) where you can get fast help, bring in your own ideas and discuss with us suggestions from other developers.
