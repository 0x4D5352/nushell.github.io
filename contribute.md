If you are a developer who would like to contribute to Nu, feel free to start working with us on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/nushell/nushell).

We are also currently writing a [contributors book](https://github.com/nushell/contributor-book). It attempts to cover the basics of how Nu works internally, to better enable you to have a solid understanding of Nu and how best to contribute.

We also have active discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nu_shell). Here you can get help, bring in your own ideas and visions for evolving Nu and discuss suggestions from other developers.
