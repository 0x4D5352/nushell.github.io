We have a few good resources for you to get started with Nu.

At the bottom of this page you can also find quick references to the commands provided by Nu Shell if you need quick support.

# Books

## Nu Book

You can read our [book](https://book.nushell.sh) to lern more about the core concepts behind Nu. It covers a lot of examples which will help you to have an easy start. 

## Contributor Book

In the [contributers book](https://github.com/nushell/contributor-book) you can find further information. It attempts to cover the basics of how Nu works internally, to get a solid understanding. You will learn how data is treated, what kind of data types Nu supports and how you can write plugins for it.

## Cookbook

The [cookbook](https://github.com/nushell/cookbook) is another book which will cover more stuff in the future.
