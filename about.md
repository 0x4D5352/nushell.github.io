We have active discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nu_shell), where you can get help from developers and other Nu users if you run into problems. Furthermore you can bring in your own ideas and visions for evolving Nu and work with us together on building this modern shell.
