# nushell.github.io

This repository contains the source for the [Nu website](https://www.nushell.sh). The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses the static site generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

# Test it locally

## Install jekyll

You need to install `jekyll` and `bundler`. There is a detailed description on how to get them for different operating systems on the [jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## Build

The easiest way to build the site is to run

```shell
> bundle exec jekyll  serve
```

in your local folder of the repo. This will run a local web server and you can view the website at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

The website will also be automatically recompiled every time you make changes.
